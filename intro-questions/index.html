            <li>Hi, I'm Josh Elboom, a junior (c/o '26) studying Communication Design! </li>
            <li>Although my interests weren't super piqued after Intro to Comp Sci freshman year, I still enjoy learning about the behind-the-scenes of webpages as that's something I'd like to work with in the future (more so the UI/UX part, though). </li>
            <li>I have 4 months of experience with JS, and went through basic HTML with the HCI club on campus. </li>
            <li>I'd love to become comfortable with creating everything related to scalable & interactive elements, as well as be able to take lessons from this class into my Wix editing/updating in my marketing internship. </li>
            <li>As mentioned above, I expect designing for screen to require lots more thinking for several ratios & sizes. The move from static to hover states & interactive elements is also a noticeable difference. </li>
            <li><a href="https://seatgeek.com/">Seat Geek</a> contains super intuitive design throughout. Having used it a ton for concert and ballpark tickets the past month, it presents relevant info in a simple, grid like patter with easy-to-use carousels and panels that also update based on your location, what's new, what's selling fast, and based on your past purchases. </li>
            <li>The <a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024">Paris 2024 Olympics</a> site provides such a wide array of info from current scores, upcoming times, articles, and ways to get invovled without overwhelming the user. Considering the hundreds of sports and countries involved, the designers are able to keep viewers informed while also learning about sports they might not know much about. </li>
            <li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/">Adobe Fonts</a> knows who it is and excels at delivering for anyong looking through typefaces. The site takes out a ton of the headache that can come with combing for hours for something specific through Google. It organizes beautifully with panels for type families, promoting creators/foundries, and easily exploring related fonts. The site also functions extremely well by syncing your downloads to your computer for whatever external program you want to input your new typeface. </li>
